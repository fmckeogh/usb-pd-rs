Rust USB-PD library, driver for the FUSB302B, and firmware for the ZY12PDN USB-PD trigger board (ported from [manuelbl/zy12pdn-oss](https://github.com/manuelbl/zy12pdn-oss)).

## Structure

The `usb-pd` library implements the USB-PD logic. A `Source` or `Sink` have corresponding `Driver` traits which are implemented by USB hardware drivers, such as `fusb302b`.

## Usage

```
$ DEFMT_LOG=trace DEFMT_RTT_BUFFER_SIZE=128 cargo r -r
```

The MCU on the ZY12PDN board has limited flash so it will not fit without the release profile and a reduced RTT buffer size of 128 bytes.
